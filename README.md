# Retina_blood_vessel
Presented here are the MATLAB codes for analyzing retina blood vessels in microscope images. The "Main" function allows for batch analysis of images captured from the retina's blood vessels. The individual image processing is carried out by the "hole_count_2" function, which involves several steps: 1) image binarization, 2) thresholding, 3) removal of touching borders, 4) counting the number of holes in the retina blood vessels and calculating the area of these holes.
